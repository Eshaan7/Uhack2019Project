## The Why

The Cost Of Living varies greatly with countries, even cities. <br/>
Migration to different countries can be a tedious task considering the differences in cost of living, inflation, etc. <br/>
Our project aims to ease this process. <br/>
We devised an innovative solution for this problem, which at its core is utilizing machine learning to asses the sustainability of people’s basic needs, and offering them insights into whether or not it’s the right decision for them.
